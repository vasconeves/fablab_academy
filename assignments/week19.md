* *What does it do?*
* *Who's done what beforehand?*
* *What did you design?*
* *What materials and components were used?*
* *Where did they come from?*
* *How much did they cost?*
* *What parts and systems were made?*
* *What processes were used?*
* *What questions were answered?*
* *What worked? What didn't?*
* *How was it evaluated?*
* *What are the implications?*
* *Prepare a summary slide and a one minute video showing its conception, construction, and operation. Your project should incorporate 2D and 3D design, additive and subtractive fabrication processes, electronics design and production, embedded microcontroller interfacing and programming, system integration and packaging.*
* *Where possible, you should make rather than buy the parts of your project. Projects can be separate or joint, but need to show individual mastery of the skills, and be independently operable. Present your final project, weekly and group assignments, and documentation.*
